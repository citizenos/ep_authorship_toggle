#ep_authorship_toggle

An Etherpad Lite plugin that adds button to the toolbar to toggle authorship colors on and off. Plus it shows the list of authors in case the authorship colors are on.

As seen, the authorship colors icon was reused for the feature.

## Why?

Usually the authorship color setting is in the "Settings" menu. I wanted to have it on the main toolbar.
I also wanted the list of authors to be shown when the colors are enabled, like it is in the timeslider view.
